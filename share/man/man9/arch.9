.Sh NAME
.Nm arch - vega arch information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/machdep.h
.In machine/cpu.h
.In machine/pmap.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NOTE: All examples will be for x86_64 but can be applied to others


Information about how Vega and architectures work together. This
will describe headers and .c files that need to exist for all
architectures and things they should include. The
.Ft machine/cpu.h
file contains information about the CPU for the specific
architecture. Required structures in this header include the
.Ft cpu_info
struct which contains CPU specific fields.

Example
.Ft cpu_info
structure for x86_64 is shown below:

.Bd -literal
struct cpu_info {
    void *pmap;                     /* Current pmap */
    volatile uint32_t lapic_freq;
    ...
};
.Ed

The macro
.Ft this_cpu()
calls an internal function that fetches the
cpu_info structure for the current CPU.

The macro
.Ft get_bsp()
calls an internal function that fetches the
cpu_info structure for the BSP.

The function these macros call must return a pointer
to a
.Ft cpu_info
structure.

In the
.Ft machine/pmap.h
header, should be a struct containing information
about the address space. This header MUST be implemented
or compiler errors will occur.
